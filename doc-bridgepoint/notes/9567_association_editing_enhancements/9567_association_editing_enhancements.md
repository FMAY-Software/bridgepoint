# Enhanced association editing  
### xtUML Project Analysis Note

### 1. Abstract

This note analyzes some approaches to which we could enhance editing support in the tool for associations.  

### 2. Document References
<a id="2.1"></a>2.1 [BridgePoint DEI #9567](https://support.onefact.net/issues/9567) Cardinality on right click menu  

### 3. Background

Modifying association related data currently requires selecting the association, leaving the diagram editor, and navigating the properties view.  This is inconvenient.

### 4. Requirements

This section describes the requirements that need to be satisfied.  If there 
is an SRS, this section may simply refer to it.  Each requirement should be as 
short and simple as possible and must be clearly defined. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

4.1 Item 1  
4.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element
  * Example Sub list item

4.2 Item 2  
4.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

### 5. Analysis

This section is only required if there is no preceding analysis note. If present
it sets out a brief analysis of the problem to be resolved by this design note. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

5.1 Item 1  
5.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

5.2 Item 2  
5.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

### 6. Work Required

In this section, break out the consequential work (as a numbered list) needed
to meet the requirements specified in the Requirements section. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

6.1 Item 1  
6.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

6.2 Item 2  
6.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

### 7. Acceptance Test

In this section, list the tests that need to be performed in order to
verify that all the requirements are satisfied. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

7.1 Item 1  
7.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

7.2 Item 2  
7.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element
