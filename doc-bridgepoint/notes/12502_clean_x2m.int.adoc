= Add 'clean' to MASL export

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

The MASL exporter currently does not remove any files during export. This is
fine most of the time, however it can sometimes result in unexpected behavior.
This change will add a mechanism to clean the output directory before export.

== 2 Introduction and Background

None.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 A mechanism shall be added to remove all files from the target export directory before export

==== 3.1.1 The mechanism shall work in Eclipse and on through the CLI

==== 3.1.2 The mechanism shall be configurable (default on)

== 4 Work Required

=== 4.1 `Xtuml2Masl.java`

The core export behavior is implemented in the `Xtuml2Masl` class. Both the
Eclipse plugin and the CLI script invoke this class. A recursive tree removal is
implemented here and a new configuration parameter is added. On the command
line, it can be skipped by adding the `-xc` option.

=== 4.2 Preferences

A new checkbox was added to the MASL export preferences. This option can be
enabled/disabled on a per project basis via the project preferences. The default
is "checked".

== 5 Implementation Comments

Since I was using the MASL template domain as the test model, I took the
opportunity to do a bit of upgrade. I made the folloinwg maintenance changes:

. Removed all of the previously configured builders (none of them were used and some where defunct).
. Added the MASL export builder.
. Removed all types from the `types` package which are duplicates of built in
xtUML types (e.g. string, integer).
. Updated the example type `ex_type` to be a native xtUML structured type rather
than using the type definition field.
. Performed "Load and Persist" to upgrade all the SQL to match the latest
schema.

== 6 Unit Test

=== 6.1 Eclipse test (with clean)

. Import the MASL template project in a fresh workspace
. Create a domain function called "foo"
. Generate MASL. *Confirm that "foo.svc" appears in the output location*
. Remove "foo".
. Generate MASL again. *Confirm that "foo.svc" no longer appears in the output
location*

=== 6.2 CLI test (with clean)

. Re-add the "foo" function
. Generate MASL. *Confirm that "foo.svc" appears in the output location*
. Remove "foo" again.
. Generate MASL from the command line using the following command from the
project directory:

  <path_to_bp_home>/tools/mc/bin/xtuml2masl -i . -d MASLTemplate -o masl/

. *Confirm that "foo.svc" no longer appears in the output location*

=== 6.3 Eclipse test (without clean)

. Back in Eclipse, navigate to the project properties "xtUML Project > MASL
Exporter"
. Uncheck the "Remove old files before export (clean)" checkbox
. Re-add the "foo" function
. Generate MASL. *Confirm that "foo.svc" appears in the output location*
. Remove "foo" again.
. Generate MASL again. *Confirm that "foo.svc" still appears in the output
location*

=== 6.4 CLI test (without clean)

. Re-add the "foo" function
. Generate MASL. *Confirm that "foo.svc" appears in the output location*
. Remove "foo" again.
. Generate MASL from the command line using the following command from the
project directory:

  <path_to_bp_home>/tools/mc/bin/xtuml2masl -xc -i . -d MASLTemplate -o masl/

. *Confirm that "foo.svc" still appears in the output location*
