= CLI script import changes

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

Users have requested updates to the BridgePoint CLI script to better meet usage
requirements.

== 2 Introduction and Background

Users of the BridgePoint CLI script have noticed some problems with how they
have traditionally managed their working environments and how the CLI script
allows them to manage their working environments in issues <<dr-1>> and 
<<dr-2>>. 

== 3 Requirements

The following requirements are taken from issues <<dr-1>> and <<dr-2>>.

=== 3.1 Create a new project outside of $WORKSPACE

From <<dr-1>>, '`CLI Import needs an option to specify the directory for the 
destination of the project creation. i.e., mirrors the functionality in the 
eclipse "New Project" pop-up.`'

=== 3.2 Ensure the -i option for the xtuml2masl command works with 3.1.

From <<dr-1>>, "`Related to this, the -i option on xtuml2masl is somewhat
confusing when trying to export a domain created as above.`"

=== 3.3 Ensure documentation for CLI matches new implementation

Add new option and usage notes for the option.

=== 3.4 Ensure project deletion doesn't occur unintentionally

An existing project is automatically deleted, even if the -deleteProject option
isn't specified. This should be changed, so the user is notified the project
already exists and has to intentionally delete it.

=== 3.5 Importing a file should work like importing a project

Importing a file will fail if the workspace project doesn't exist, while 
importing a project will work if the workspace doesn't exist. This 
inconsistancy should be addressed by creating the workspace project.

== 4 Work Required

=== 4.1 Add option for destination outside of $WORKSPACE

Add the option and add support for the option for both project and file
importing.

=== 4.2 Check usage of the -i option of xtuml2masl

=== 4.3 Add check before deleting project

Add a check of the -deleteProject option before deleting a project, and add some
user output in the case where the -deleteProject option isn't used and the
project already exists.

=== 4.4 Add workspace project creation for file imports

The workspace directory is created by the CLI.sh script.

==== 4.4.1 -project, -deleteProject, project exists

# Delete project
# Create project
# Import file into project

==== 4.4.2 -project, no -deleteProject, project exists

# Warn user the project exists

==== 4.4.3 no -project, -deleteProject, project exists

# Delete project (project name based on file name)
# Create project
# Import file into project

==== 4.4.4 no -project, no -deleteProject, project exists

# Warn user the project exists (project name based on file name)

=== 4.5 Update documentation

== 5 Acceptance Test

Verify that target destination is used for project files.

Verify 3.2 and 3.3.
