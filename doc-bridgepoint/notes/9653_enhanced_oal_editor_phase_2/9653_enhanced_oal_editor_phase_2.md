In this section, list all the documents that the reader may need to refer to.
Give the full path to reference a file.  
<a id="2.1"></a>2.1 [BridgePoint DEI #9653](https://support.onefact.net/issues/9653) Enhanced OAL phase 2    
<a id="2.2"></a>2.2 [Use Case note phase 1](https://github.com/travislondon/bridgepoint/blob/9749_usecases/doc-bridgepoint/notes/9749_usecases/9749_usecases_phase_1.md) Phase one use case note.  
<a id="2.3"></a>2.3 [Use Case note phase 2](https://github.com/travislondon/bridgepoint/blob/9749_usecases/doc-bridgepoint/notes/9749_usecases/9749_usecases_phase_2.md) Phase two use case note.  

### 3. Background

During the phase one work for an enhanced OAL editor it was decided that some suppport would be pulled.  Comparing [[2]](#2.2) and [[2]](#2.3) will show the differences between what use cases were supported with phase one.  Phase two shall support all use cases listed in [[2]](#2.3).

### 4. Requirements

This section describes the requirements that need to be satisfied.  If there 
is an SRS, this section may simply refer to it.  Each requirement should be as 
short and simple as possible and must be clearly defined. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

4.1 Item 1  
4.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element
* Example Sub list item

4.2 Item 2  
4.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

### 5. Analysis

This section is only required if there is no preceding analysis note. If present
it sets out a brief analysis of the problem to be resolved by this design note. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

5.1 Item 1  
5.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

5.2 Item 2  
5.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

### 6. Work Required

In this section, break out the consequential work (as a numbered list) needed
to meet the requirements specified in the Requirements section. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

6.1 Item 1  
6.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

6.2 Item 2  
6.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

### 7. Acceptance Test

In this section, list the tests that need to be performed in order to
verify that all the requirements are satisfied. Here is an example reference to the Document References section [[2.1]](#2.1)

7.1 Item 1  
7.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

7.2 Item 2  
7.2.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element
