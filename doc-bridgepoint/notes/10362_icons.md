# Splash screen and icon wrong on Windows 
### xtUML Project Implementation Note


### 1. Abstract

This note describes the work performed to fix the Windows splash screen and the 
application icons on eclipse oxygen.

### 2. Document References
<a id="2.1"></a>2.1 [BridgePoint DEI #10362](https://support.onefact.net/issues/10362) Headline issue.    
<a id="2.2"></a>2.2 [Creating icons for Eclipse RCP launcher](http://andrius.velykis.lt/2012/10/creating-icons-for-eclipse-rcp-launcher/) - help article

### 3. Background

With the move to eclipse oxygen we noticed that the splash screen did not work on 
Windows.  We also noted that the application icons were the standard eclipse icons
and not our BridgePoint "green chip triangle".  We wish to fix these.  

### 4. Requirements

4.1 Splash screen shall display appropriately on Windows, Linux, and OSX  
4.2 Application icons shall be set appropriately on Windows and OSX. 
4.2.1  An icon shall be provided on Linux for the user to apply to shortcuts he 
creates. 

### 5. Work Required

5.1  Bitmap images created with Gimp will display and open as valid files on 
Windows but eclipse will sometimes fail to use them as splash screens.  The fix is
to open the BMP on a Windows OS with MS Paint and then use Paint to save the file
back to BMP format.  We must do this for our splash.bmp.  
 
5.2 Eclipse uses the product definition file to find icons for all OSes to apply to
the product executable it creates.  Update the product and product-dev projects 
with icons for use on all three OSes.   
5.2.1  Follow the help guide in [2.2]   
5.2.2  Create a linux xpm icon file  
5.2.3  Create a MacOS iconset  
5.2.4  Create Windows bitmap icons using Pixelformer [2.3]   

### 6. Implementation Comments

6.1  To work around an eclipse bug that would not read icons from another plugin, I
had to put the icon files in both the product and product-dev plugins and use relative
paths in the product definition files.   

6.2  On Windows, I created a multi-layer ICO file that is saved in the product 
plugins along with the individual bitmaps.  This ICO file is, however, not used as
we chose to specify each bitmap file size path individually.  

### 7. Unit Test

7.1 Start the application on all 3 operating systems.  Verify the BridgePoint
splash is displayed.  
 
7.2 Windows   
7.2.1  Verify the bridgepoint.exe executable icon is the green chip

7.3 OSX  
7.3.1  Verify the BridgePoint app icon is the green chip  

7.4 Linux  
7.4.1  Verify the installation folder contains the file `icon.xpm` that is the 
green chip
