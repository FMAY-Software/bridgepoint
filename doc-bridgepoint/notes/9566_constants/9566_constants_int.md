# Constant group item visibility
### xtUML Project Implementation Note

### 1. Abstract

User requests:
> Constant groups and their items are visible across projects globally. The
> "namespace" of a constant has to be included in the name to avoid naming
> conflicts. Suggestion is to at least hide the items behind the constant group
> name similar to how enums and enum items are managed.
