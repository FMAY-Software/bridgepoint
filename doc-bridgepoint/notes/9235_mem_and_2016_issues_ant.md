The One Fact test plan was created using a 1:1 mapping of tests from the (Use Cases In The 
Model Element Move Statement of Work)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_T4H7StO-VM8zfIFjr-V7VwUQMXML1c7nFJJofU0vGs/edit#heading=h.bs05sw301j79]. The link provided here provides access to all test results from the 
most recent to the very first run of the tests. These results can be seen using the document revision history. Model Element Move was introduced as part of the [BridgePoint v5.8 release](https://support.onefact.net/versions/14) which was completed November 30, 2016.

3. Background
-------------
The [Model Element Move](2.2) and and [2016 Issue List](2.3) tasks were completed as part of the 
[BridgePoint v5.8 release](https://support.onefact.net/versions/14). The Model Element Move statement of work contains a clearly defined set of use cases, and One Fact's test plan included tests that mapped to each use cases. One Fact also created extended tests during the test cycle and the [Model Element Move test document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WsYH0_gSdhurP3-jo3oG_w6itWMGnhZ99RcurpJVv44/edit) was extended to include these test additional test cases.  

For acceptance testing, (SAAB created a test procedure for Model Element Move)[2.4] and SAAB performed testing based on that procedure. SAAB also performed "extended tests" during this testing.  SAAB's test results also include BridgePoint problems that are not related to the headline issues ([2.2](2.2), [2.3](2.3)). Two different SAAB groups reported results. 
[SAAB Dynamics reported results](2.5), and [SAAB Aero reported results](2.6).  

The goal of this analysis is to clearly call out the issues specific to the work performed by One Fact ([2.2](2.2), [2.3](2.3)) and to raise specific issues for the failures that will be addressed for the warrenty associated with tasks performed by One Fact.  

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 Clearly define the SAAB failures that shall be addressed under warranty  
4.2 For each defined failure, perform a high-level analysis of the failure case  

5. Analysis
-----------
This section shall only address failure cases. 
5.1 Analysis of Issues reported by SAAB Dynamics  
5.1.1 Example sub-item
* Example List Element

5.2 Analysis of Issues reported by SAAB Aero  
5.2.1 Example sub-item

6. Work Required
----------------
6.1 Item 1  
6.1.1 Example sub-item

7. Acceptance Test
------------------
7.1 Model Element Move Testing
7.1.1 Enhance the One Fact Model Element Move test plan to include the following SAAB test plan tests
