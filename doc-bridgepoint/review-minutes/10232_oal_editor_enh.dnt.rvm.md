-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   Levi  4.3.1    Levi asks about following preference vs following what was done by previous line. Keith tested and sees that it matches the format of the previous line. We should add a comment about this behavior.
x- 02  min   Levi  2.4-2.5      formatting
x- 03  min   Levi  5      When if/then/else is all in 1 line (multiple statements on 1 line) we do not handle this. Perhaps add a design statement about this.
