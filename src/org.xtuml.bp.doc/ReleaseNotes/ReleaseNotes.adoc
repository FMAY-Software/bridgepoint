=== General Notes
* A summary of the release highlights and new functionality is available on the link:../WhatsNew/WhatsNew.html[What's New] page.  
  
* [red]#*IMPORTANT:*# BridgePoint 7.4+ requires Java 11. Java 17 is required for
full CDT functionality although all BridgePoint-only features will work with
Java 11. If Java 11/17 is not the system default JRE, then the user must
configure BridgePoint to invoke Java 11/17 explicitly. See more information on
configuring Java in
link:https://github.com/xtuml/bridgepoint/blob/master/doc-bridgepoint/process/HOWTO-configure-bp-jre.adoc[this guide].

* BridgePoint is completely open source software. Please see link:https://xtuml.org[xtuml.org] and link:https://onefact.net[onefact.net] 
for ongoing development and support of BridgePoint.  
  
* BridgePoint ships as a zip file, similar to standard eclipse packages. Users who wish to 
create desktop shortcuts to start BridgePoint should set the shortcut to start `<install dir>/bridgepoint`.  

* BridgePoint supports multiple action languages.  The default is set via workspace 
preferences at `xtUML > Action Language > Default Action Language Dialect`. The default is set to OAL.       
  
=== Interoperability with Previous Releases
BridgePoint 7.4 is compatible with workspaces and projects created with prior versions back to 
BridgePoint 6.0.  However, after opening the model in this version a modeler will not be able to 
open the model in a prior version.
