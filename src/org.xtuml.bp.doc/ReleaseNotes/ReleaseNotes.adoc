=== General Notes
* A summary of the release highlights and new functionality is available on the link:../WhatsNew/WhatsNew.html[What's New] page.  
  
* [red]#*IMPORTANT:*# BridgePoint 7.0 requires Java 11.  If Java 11 is not the
system default JRE, then the user must configure BridgePoint to invoke Java 11
explicitly.  See more information in the link:../WhatsNew/WhatsNew.html[What's New]
including a FAQ which gives steps to configure BridgePoint for Java.

* BridgePoint is completely open source software. Please see link:https://xtuml.org[xtuml.org] and link:https://onefact.net[onefact.net] 
for ongoing development and support of BridgePoint.  
  
* BridgePoint ships as a zip file, similar to standard eclipse packages. Users who wish to 
create desktop shortcuts to start BridgePoint should set the shortcut to start `<install dir>/bridgepoint`.  

* BridgePoint supports multiple action languages.  The default is set via workspace 
preferences at `xtUML > Action Language > Default Action Language Dialect`. The default is set to OAL.       
  
=== Interoperability with Previous Releases
BridgePoint 7.2 is compatible with workspaces and projects created with prior versions back to 
BridgePoint 6.0.  However, after opening the model in this version a modeler will not be able to 
open the model in a prior version.
