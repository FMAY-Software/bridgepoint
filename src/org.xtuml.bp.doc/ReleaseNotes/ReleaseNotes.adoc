* [red]#*IMPORTANT:*# BridgePoint 7.6+ requires Java 17.

BridgePoint to invoke Java 11/17 explicitly. See more information on
configuring Java in

for ongoing development and support of BridgePoint.  
  
* BridgePoint ships as a zip file, similar to standard eclipse packages. Users who wish to 
create desktop shortcuts to start BridgePoint should set the shortcut to start `<install dir>/bridgepoint`.  

* BridgePoint supports multiple action languages.  The default is set via workspace 
preferences at `xtUML > Action Language > Default Action Language Dialect`. The default is set to OAL.       
  
=== Interoperability with Previous Releases
BridgePoint 7.6 is compatible with workspaces and projects created with prior versions back to 
BridgePoint 6.0.  However, after opening the model in this version a modeler will not be able to 
open the model in a prior version.
