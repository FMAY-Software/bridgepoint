=== Eclipse 2020 and Java 11

The Eclipse version underneath BridgePoint has been upgraded in this release to
Eclipse 2020-06.  This brings BridgePoint up to a modern version of Eclipse.  More
information about Eclipse 2020-06 may be found link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/2020-06/[at this link].

Simultaneously, BridgePoint is upgraded to support and use Java 11.  BridgePoint now
uses a Java 11 JRE/JDK from the system, it is no longer inside the BridgePoint installation. 
These changes provide user experience and security improvements.

=== ASL Support

Tools and UI have been built into BridgePoint that allow modelers to convert ASL models
into xtUML that is editable inside BridgePoint.  These models can retain ASL as the action
language instead of OAL. A new editor is added to support the ASL action language.
