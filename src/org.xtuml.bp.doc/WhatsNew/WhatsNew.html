<h2 id="oal-content-assist-improvements">OAL Content Assist Improvements</h2>
<p>The OAL content assist feature is improved in this release. Specifically, BridgePoint has improved<br />
proposals in <code>relate</code>, <code>unrelate</code>, and <code>create</code> statements and numerous places where <code>self</code> and <code>param</code><br />
may be used.</p>
<p>Additionally, a bug is fixed where content assist raised a selection list at the end of a comment.</p>
<h2 id="publish-to-interface">Publish to Interface</h2>
<p>Some modelers prefer to create their application from a domain-first, bottom-up approach. This approach typically<br />
involves the creation of domain functions that help define the API in and out of the domain. When the time comes to<br />
wire the component into a full system, the modeler is left to manually create interfaces and messages that expose<br />
the API.</p>
<p>To simplify this process, BridgePoint now includes a <code>Publish to Interface...</code> tool [Figure 1]. This tool creates<br />
interface messages and parameters automatically from the selected domain functions. The tool is smart enough to<br />
update existing messages when applicable and handle situations where ambiguity exists.</p>

<h2 id="editor-enhancements">Editor Enhancements</h2>
<p>Ongoing improvements and fixes in the model editor continue.</p>
<p>Handling of referential attributes and the rules that govern when referentials and identifiers may be combined<br />
are loosened and improved.</p>
<p>A fix is made to the handling of the parameter list for class-based operation parameters if a user-defined<br />
datatype from another package is used.</p>
<p>During paste of a class, the class number is now updated automatically so the modeler is saved making the modification<br />
himself to avoid duplicate class number errors.</p>
<h2 id="masl-flow-improvements">MASL Flow Improvements</h2>
<p>All areas of the MASL to xtUML experience are improved. Several import and export issues are addressed. Types,<br />
subtype classes, and terminators are now exported cleanly to feed into downstream MASL tools.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MASL editing inside BridgePoint is more robust, specifically in the area of handling the<br />
synchronization of data stored on disk versus displayed in the editor. Problems that lead to the &quot;data out of synch&quot;<br />
error dialog have been addressed.</p>
<h2 id="concrete-polymorphic-events">Concrete Polymorphic Events</h2>
<p>The implementation of the behavior of polymorphic events as defined in the Schlaer-Mellor Executable<br />
UML methology diverged over time in BridgePoint and iUML. BridgePoint/xtUML defined polymorphic events<br />
as &quot;abstract&quot;. It defined that polymorphic events may only be handled at a single level of the supertype/subtype<br />
hierarchy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, iUML/MASL defined polymorphic events as &quot;concrete&quot;. It defined that polymorphic events must<br />
be handled at every level of the supertype/subtype hierarchy.</p>
<p>As part of the improvement of MASL capabilities BridgePoint now supports concrete polymorphic events. The feature<br />
is enabled with a installation-level setting and should only be used for models that use MASL action language. This<br />
new feature addresses problems encountered by MASL modelers.</p>
