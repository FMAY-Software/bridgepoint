To update the splash screen:
------------------------------
_- Open splash.xcf in GiMP
_- Edit
_- Export the file to BMP, overwriting the splash.bmp here.  During the export
  be sure to go to advanced options and choose 24-bit color.
_- Test the new splash screen in a BridgePoint launch.  Be sure to test on Windows.
  - If the Windows launch fails to show the splash.  Open the file with MS Paint
    and save to BMP. It writes BMP files slightly differently than GiMP does.
_- Commit the files
